// You must write two functions. The first function, readNumbers, 
// is to read a set of 10 numbers from std::cin and use them to initialise a dynamically allocated array of int of length 10. 
// The function must return a pointer to the array. You may assume that the input contains 10 integer values and nothing else.
// The second function, printNumbers,
// takes an int array of any length greater than 0 and prints all numbers in the array, one per line. 
// The numbers must be printed in order starting with the first entry. 
//Each line of output should start with the array index of the number being written out, 
// followed by a space, then the number and finally a newline.

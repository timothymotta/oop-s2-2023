// Given a binary number represented as an array, write a function that takes the array and its size as a parameter,
// and returns the integer value. You may assume that there are at least 1 and no more than 30 numbers in the array and that
// all the values are either 0 or 1. 
// The array is ordered with most significant binary digit at the start (index 0) and the least 
// significant digit at the end.
